Terminal commands for non-robots.

Graphical is a Web tool for learning and working with terminal commands

Features
---

Graphical makes learning terminal commands on your own much easier by:

* Visually showing you each part of the command
* Parsing command documentation
* Display man pages in a readable way
* Providing support for either running the command from the web browser, or copying it to the clipboard.

It is written half with a Python backend, and Javascript frontend for the user interface.
Graphical also provides easy support for custom themes and styling by editing the Jinja2 template and CSS file.
