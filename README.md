Features
---

Graphical makes learning terminal commands on your own much easier by:

* Visually showing each part of the command
* Add, remove, and update options for the command
* Parsing command documentation and help files
* Display man pages in a readable way
* Run the command and see the output in your web browser, or just copy to the clipboard

It is written  with a Python/Flask backend and Javascript frontend for the user interface.
Graphical also provides easy support for custom themes and styling by editing the Jinja2 template and CSS file.

Hacking
---

Since Graphical is just python running a web app, it's very easy to hack or configure for your own uses.
You can edit the main.css file to style it however you like, or if you're brave, take on the mess that is
the templates.html file.
